    "## Task 01 – Text Pre-Processing\n",
    "A computational analysis of natural language text typically requires several pre-processing steps, such as excluding irrelevant text parts, separating the text into words, phrases, or sentences depending on the analysis use case, removing so-called stop words, i.e., words that contain little to no semantic meaning, and normalizing the texts, e.g., by removing punctuation and capitalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the *download_file()* function developed in the past assignments to download the plain text versions of Shakespeare’s play [Macbeth](https://ia802707.us.archive.org/1/items/macbeth02264gut/0ws3410.txt) and Bacon’s [New Atlantis](https://ia801309.us.archive.org/24/items/newatlantis02434gut/nwatl10.txt). If you choose not to implement assignment 4, task 6, download the files manually. We will also provide some txt files.\n",

    "    - Information about the file, acknowledgements, copyright notices etc.\n",
    "    - Headings indicating the act and scene\n",
    "    - Stage instructions\n",
    "    - Character names\n",
    "2. *normalize_text()*\n",
    "    - converts all text to lower case\n",
    "    - removes all punctuation from the texts\n",
    "3. *remove_stopwords()* – eliminates all stop words that are part of the list of English stop words (we provide two lists of stopwords, try both and see how they perform)\n",
    "4. *tokenize_text()* – splits the cleaned text into words\n",

    "The [Baconian theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baconian_theory_of_Shakespeare_authorship) holds that Sir Francis Bacon is the author of Shakespeare’s plays.
