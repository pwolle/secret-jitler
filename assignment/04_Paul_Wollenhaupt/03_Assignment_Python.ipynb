Write a function that spans a dictionary holding a default balance of 0 for an initial list of customers. For simplicity, assume customer names are unique identifier.  (optional) Can you express that same functionality using a lambda function?\n","2. What are elegant ways to add or remove single and multiple customers using the functionality of dict?\n","3. Now write two simple functions that allow you to deposit and withdraw money for a given bank customer.\n","4.

(Inheritance) Write a child class *SavingsCustomer* that inherits its features from the parent class *Customer*. A savings customer has an extra savings balance for receiving extra interest.
